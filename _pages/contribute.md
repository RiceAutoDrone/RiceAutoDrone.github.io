Any bug? Do you miss an interesting feature? Do you want to add your awesome skin to <span class="chulapa">Chulapa</span>? A typo on the docs?

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/dieghernan/chulapa/issues/new/choose) or leave a comment. Some specific known issues or potential contributions you can help us with:

- **Docs**: As english is not my primary language, the docs are likely to be plenty of typos. Please feel free to correct them.

- **Skins**: If you want to implement your own theme [follow the guide on theming]() and open an issue?

- **Localization of dates**: Currently is limited to a few languages ([see here](https://dieghernan.github.io/chulapa/docs/04-layouts#localization-of-dates)), so if you miss any language:
   -   Have a look to [the source code](https://github.com/dieghernan/chulapa/blob/master/_includes/snippets/datetranslate.html)
   -   [Open an issue](https://github.com/dieghernan/chulapa/issues/new/choose) describing your implementation
   -  PR!
