  <p><strong>Dean Village</strong> (from <em>dene</em>, meaning ‘<em>deep valley</em>’) is a former village immediately northwest of the city centre of Edinburgh, Scotland. It was known as the “Water of Leith Village” and was the centre of a successful grain milling area for more than 800 years. At one time there were no fewer than eleven working mills there, driven by the strong currents of the Water of Leith.</p>
