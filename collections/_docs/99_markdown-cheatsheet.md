### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

```html
<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

## What‚Äôs kramdown?

**kramdown** supercharges Markdown with some interesting features.

**kramdown** is the default Jekyll Markdown processor. When creating your site with Jekyll, you can use the standard Markdown syntax plus some specific **kramdown** syntax. Jekyll would render your Markdown/**kramdown** into HTML.

The first paragraph.

This is a paragraph  
which contains a hard line break.

## Create a table of contents:

On your `_config.yaml`, define the levels of your toc:

```yaml
kramdown:
  ...
  toc_levels: 2..6

```

Ignore specific headers:

```markdown

## This header would be ignored on the toc.
{:.no_toc}

```

### This header would be ignored on the toc.
{:.no_toc}

Add this to generate table

```markdown

* This line is needed, but won't appear. Replace '*' with '1' to create a numbered list.
{:toc}


```

* This line is needed, but won't appear. Replace '*' with '1' to create a numbered list.
